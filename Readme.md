# Chocolatey Packages

This is a [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) `packages.config` compatible file that I use to install my default applications across Windows computers that I use regularly. 

## Requirements

You must have chocolatey installed on your Windows system before being able to use this file.

You can get started with Chocolatey installation by visiting the [official documentation](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation).

## Installation

After cloning the repo or downloading the file, run the following command in an elevated Powershell:

```powershell
choco install .\path\to\packages.config -y
```

## Contributions

Have an awesome application you can't live without that's not on my list? I'd love to hear about it! Email me at [patrick@labbett.net](mailto:patrick@labbett.net)
